    <h1>My school</h1> 
   <p>I am studying in gems united indian school. Which  is in baniyas west, abudhabi, uae. I am styding in 8th grade. My sister is also 
       studying in this school.She is in kg2-c. I last visited my school in 2020 march. I did'nt go to school for 1 year now because of corona.
       Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. 
       The main step to acquire education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. 
    Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. My school is my second home where I spend most of my time. 
    Above all, it gives me a platform to do better in life and also builds my personality. 
    I feel blessed to study in one of the most prestigious and esteemed schools of the city.
     In addition, my school has a lot of assets which makes me feel fortunate to be a part of it. 
    I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.
</p>
    <h1>
    Why I Love My School?
</h1>
<p> It is well-equipped with all the contemporary gadgets. 
    I see my school as a lighthouse of education bestowing knowledge as well as ethical conduct upon us.
     In contrast to other schools, my school does not solely focus on academic performance.
      In other words, it emphasizes on the overall development of their students.</p>
<p>Along with our academics, extra-curricular activities are also organized at our school. 
    This one of the main reasons why I love my school as it does not measure everyone on the same scale. 
    Our hardworking staff gives time to each child to grow at their own pace which instills confidence in them.
     My school has all the facilities of a library, computer room, playground, basketball court and more, 
     to ensure we have it all at our disposal.</p>
    <h1>What has My School Taught Me?</h1> 
    <p>If someone asked me what I have learned from my school, I wonâ€™t be able to answer it in one sentence. 
        For the lessons are irreplaceable and I can never be thankful enough for them. I learned to share because of my school. 
        The power of sharing and sympathy was taught to me by my school. 
        I learned how to be considerate towards animals and it also one of the main reasons why I adopted a pet.

    </p>
<p>A school is a place where I developed my artistic skills which were further enhanced by my teachers. 
    Subsequently, it led me to participate in inter-school completions through which I earned various awards. 
    Most importantly, my school taught me how to face failures with grace and never give up on my ambitions, no matter what happens.</p>
<p>To sum it up, studying in one of the respected schools has helped me a lot personally. 
    I will always be indebted to my school for shaping my personality and teaching me invaluable lessons. 
    It has given me friends for life and teachers that I will always look up to. 
    I aspire to carry on the values imbibed by my school to do well in life and make it proud.</p>
